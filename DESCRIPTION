Description: Analyze the phenotypic evolution of species
    of hybrid origin on a phylogenetic network. This can detect a burst of variation
    at the formation of a hybrid as well as an increase or decrease in trait
    value at a hybridization event. Parameters are estimated by maximum
    likelihood, and model averaging can be done automatically. Users need to
    enter a comparative data set and a phylogenetic network.
